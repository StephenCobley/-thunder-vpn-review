*Thunder is an Android VPN service launched in 2017 by a company called Signal Lab. Thunder VPN boasts more than 50 million downloads on Google Play, which definitely got our attention*

+  It’s also advertised as the best Android VPN on the market. This is why we decided to test Thunder VPN thoroughly and see what levels of protection and performance it can offer

+  Thunder VPN was launched in 2017 as a basic beginner-friendly VPN for Android. However, the company doesn’t share many important details regarding its security setup. Its logging policy is vague at best and it doesn’t even have a kill switch

+  Thunder VPN operates an unknown number of servers across 20+ countries. Its performance was quite poor during our testing, though. It doesn’t work with Netflix or other streaming services and is generally too slow for basic use as well

+  Customer support needs a lot more work and the prices are too high for what it currently offers
